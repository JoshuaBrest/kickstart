    \section{Introduction}

    Kickstart is a tool to quickly install apps onto a mac. It is written purely in shell script and is thus easy to use. It does however require a homebrew plugin which it does automaticly install, but that's it.
    
    \section{Usage}
        As Kickstart is writen in pure shell, it is only one command that is require to install all the configured apps.
